#  NextGen MMO Architecture: A platform for building massive online games

NextGen MMO Architecture is a platform for building massive online games. The architecture is developed in [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), making it easier to scale and distribute.

The NextGen MMO Architecture makes as few assumptions on the game logic as possible, allowing any kind of game online game to be developed, for example: online poker, RPG/FPS/RTS or just a simple chat server.

The architecture consists of five types of servers:

* Connection Server
* Account Server
* Character Server
* Area Servers
* Monitor Server
