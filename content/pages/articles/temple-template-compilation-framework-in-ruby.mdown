#  TEMPLE: Template compilation framework in Ruby

TEMPLE is "Rack" for Templating engines: http://judofyr.net/posts/temple.html Nice! (via [@assaf](http://twitter.com/assaf))

> The idea is to build an engine based on a chain of compilers. A compiler is simply a class which has a method called #compile which takes one arguments. Itâ€™s illegal for a compiler to mutate the argument, and it should be possible to use the same instance several times.
