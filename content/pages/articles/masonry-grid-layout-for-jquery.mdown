#  Masonry: Grid layout for jQuery

Cool layout plugin for jQuery from [@desandro](http://twitter.com/desandro) with support for infinite scroll as well.

> Think of it as the flip side of CSS floats. Whereas floating arranges elements horizontally then vertically, Masonry arranges elements vertically then horizontally according to a grid.
