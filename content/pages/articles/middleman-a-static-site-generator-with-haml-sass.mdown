#  Middleman: A static site generator with Haml, Sass, Compass + YUI compression and cache busting

Written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Middleman is built upon [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). In fact, the Middleman `init.rb` is evaluated within a Sinatra context so anything you could do in Sinatra can be done in Middleman. Very nice!!

Middleman watches your template files (Haml, Sass, Erb, Builder, Maruku & Markaby) for changes and provides a development environment for rapid site creation and prototyping. Some important features are layouts, ruby helpers and the integration of the Compass CSS library. Hawt!!
