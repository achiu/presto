#  Text-Haml: Haml Parser in Perl

Don't look now, but you can get your Haml on in Perl too. Text-Haml is a newly released Haml parser written in Perl by [Viacheslav Tykhanovskyi](http://github.com/vti).

Of course we love to see the ecosystem of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) / [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) grow to further reaches.
