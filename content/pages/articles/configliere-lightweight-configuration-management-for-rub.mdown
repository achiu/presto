#  Configliere: lightweight configuration management for Ruby

> Configliere manage settings from many sources: static constants, simple config files, environment variables, commandline options, straight ruby. You donâ€™t have to predefine anything, but you can ask configliere to type-convert, require, document or password-obscure any of its fields. Modules can define config settings independently of each other and the main program.

Bonus points for a hilarious [README](http://github.com/mrflip/configliere#readme).
